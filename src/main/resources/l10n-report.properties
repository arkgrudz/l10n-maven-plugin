message.malformedParameters.title=Malformed formatting parameters
message.malformedParameters.description=Some parameters have a bad syntax. For instance: {0<span>{1}} will cause a runtime exception when formatting.
message.jdValidation.title=Invalid characters in js resource
message.jdValidation.description=\",\\n and \\r need to be avoided in js resources, ' should be prefered. If js resource is used with [var text=\"<fmt:message key='resource.js.label'/>\";] unescaped \" trigger a js error in the page. Note that Properties consume one \\ escaping before quotes, so to escaping needs to be \\\\\".
message.UnescapedQuotesParams.title=Unescaped single quotes with parameters
message.UnescapedQuotesParams.description=The following resources contain parameters ({0},...), as well as unescaped single quotes ('). They need to be escaped as (''), or will get removed by MessageFormat (<fmt:message> + <fmt:param>). Note that ' used as escaping group (ex: 'formatting escaped {text}') is not supported by the validator.
message.htmlValidation.title=XHTML Validation
message.htmlValidation.description=The following HTML resources did not pass XHTML 1.0 transitional validation, with assumption that resource could be inserted in a <div></div> element. Some usual errros: unopened/unclosed tags: <br> [<br/>], < br/> [<br/>], unescaped entities: & [&amp;], non lowercase  tags: onClick [onclick], unquoted attributes href=http:// [href="http://"]... Javascript unescaping (for js resources) as well as formatting (if resource contains any {i} parameter)) are applied before validation.
message.urlValidation.title=URL validation
message.urlValidation.description=The following URL resources do not match absolute URL pattern. Frequent cause are missing protocol ( protocol relative URLs are allowed) or an extra space/newline at the end of resource. HTML unescaping as well as parameters formatting (if any) are applied before validation.
message.plainTextWithHtml.title=Plain text resource contain HTML

message.escapedQuoteWithoutParam.title=Single quote escaped but no parameters
message.escapedQuoteWithoutParam.description=Escaped single quote will not be consumed unless formatting is applied (i.e <fmt:param> is used) even if no parameter is actually used in the resource, which may be a valid use case. In order to simplify a bit, for js resource with some parametric replacement being done in javascript, the formatter should consume escaped quote as MessageFormat does.  

message.missingTranslation.title=Missing translation
message.missingTranslation.description=The following resources are translated in at least 2 languages, but not in all languages. This may be valid if translation is on-going, or parts of the website are not available in all languages.
