#Errors
message.malformedParameters.title=Malformed formatting parameters
message.malformedParameters.description=Some parameters have a bad syntax. For instance: {0<span>{1}} will cause a runtime exception when formatting.
message.jsDoubleQuotedValidation.title=Uunescaped double quote in js resource
message.jsDoubleQuotedValidation.description=\" is not allowed in a double quoted js resources. An unescaped \" in [var text=\"<fmt:message key='resource.js.label'/>\";] would trigger a js error in the page. Single quotes should be preferred, or double quotes need to be escaped. Note that Properties consume one \\ escaping before quotes, so correct escaping will be \\\\\".
message.jsSingleQuotedValidation.title=Unescaped single quote in js resource
message.jsSingleQuotedValidation.description=' is not allowed in a single quoted js resources. An unescaped ' in [var text='<fmt:message key=\"resource.js.label\"/>\';] would trigger a js error in the page. Double quotes should be preferred, or single quotes need to be escaped. Note that Properties consume one \\ escaping before quotes, so correct escaping will be \\\\\'.
message.jsNewlineValidation.title=Invalid newline character in js resource
message.jsNewlineValidation.description=\\n and \\r are not allowed in js resources. Newline character is considered as the end of a javascript statement by browsers and would create a script error.
message.UnescapedQuotesParams.title=Unescaped single quotes with parameters
message.UnescapedQuotesParams.description=The following resources contain parameters ({0},...), as well as unescaped single quotes ('). They need to be escaped with another quote (''), or will get removed by MessageFormat (<fmt:message> + <fmt:param>). Note that ' used as escaping group (ex: 'formatting escaped {text}') is not supported by the validator and would trigger a false positive.
message.htmlValidation.title=XHTML Validation
message.htmlValidation.description=The following HTML resources did not pass XHTML 1.0 transitional validation, with assumption that resource could be inserted in a <div></div> element. Some usual errors: unopened/unclosed tags: <br> [<br/>], < br/> [<br/>], unescaped entities: & [&amp;], non lowercase  tags: onClick [onclick], unquoted attributes href=http:// [href="http://"]... Javascript unescaping (for js resources) as well as formatting (if resource contains any {i} parameter)) are applied before validation.
message.urlValidation.title=URL validation
message.urlValidation.description=The following URL resources do not match absolute URL pattern. Frequent cause are missing protocol ( protocol relative URLs are allowed) or an extra space/newline at the end of resource. HTML unescaping as well as parameters formatting (if any) are applied before validation.
message.plainTextWithHtml.title=Plain text resource contains HTML
message.plainTextWithHtml.description=The following resources were flagged as plain text (i.e for use on alt, titles, input names, etc), but seem to contain some HTML tags that will not be rendered correctly.
message.plainTextWithUrl.title=Plain text resource contains URL
message.plainTextWithUrl.description=The following resources were flagged as plain text, but seem to contain an URL which would not behave as intended.
message.incoherentParams.title=Incoherent usage of parameters
message.incoherentParams.description=Some parameters are used differently (either number of parameters and/or index used) between properties sharing the same key. For the comparison, parameter order is ignored, as well as sub-formatting elements (i.e. {0,date} is considered as {0})
message.escapedQuoteWithoutParam.title=Single quote escaped but no parameters
message.escapedQuoteWithoutParam.description=Escaped single quote will not be consumed unless formatting is applied (i.e <fmt:param> is used) even if no parameter is actually used in the resource, which may be a valid use case. In order to simplify a bit, for js resource with some parametric replacement being done in javascript, the formatter should consume escaped quote as MessageFormat does.  
message.customPattern.title=Custom patterns
message.customPattern.description=The following resources did not match specified custom pattern.

#Warning
message.missingTranslation.title=Missing translation
message.missingTranslation.description=The following resources are translated in at least 2 languages, but not in all languages. This may be valid if translation is on-going, or parts of the website are not available in all languages. The resources from root bundle (file name without a _) are not taken into account, as it usually contains resources that do not need localization.

message.undeclaredUrl.title=Undeclared URL resources
message.undeclaredUrl.description=The following resources seem to contain URL, but keys were not configured as such in plugin configuration
